00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,566
i shout for it is a happy day

178
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,000
it is rare to get a body or be a dead

179
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,900

00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,066
but some electric current so i could have kept her life

182
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:00,566
but she intended

183
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,866
i knew nothing of the life she had abandoned except she hated it

184
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,133
so much that she had chosen not to be

185
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:13,900
and forever what would she feel on being dragged from her

186
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,966
carefully chosen like eternity and

187
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:20,866

a crime who was i to decide her fate

191
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:36,300

i she's perhaps you should marry her what i think she loves you

228
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:38,966
i've seen people look at each other

229
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:42,000
with loveness and observant subject

230
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,933

234
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,933
i was wondering if perhaps

235
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,900
you were raising her to be your mistress a dark thought

236
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,333
unworthy of me i know

237
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,933
so you were not playing with her

238
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:34,166
spinatic ejaculation can only induce homeostasis in me

239
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:38,166
if accompanied by prolonged stimulation of higher nerve seconds

240
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,933
whose pressure on the doctor's glance changes

241
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:44,400
the chemistry of my blood not for a few spasmoded minutes

242
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,766
but for many days

243
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,000
but i am unit

244
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,600
and that fuck off to get a sexual response for my body

245
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,733
would take the same amount of electricity as roms

246
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:01,666
north London besides my fraternal feelings seem to obey

247
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,266
my sexual thoughts

248
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,966
i apologize for my own

249
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,200
thoughtful not back at all meant

250

a man was teaching me chess

504
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,866
and he said he thought i would probably have the softest skin

505
00:56:56,866 --> 00:56:58,000
he had ever touched

506
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,733
when i said if i did it would be the inner thighs to test

507
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,666
as that is where the epidermis is at its most fine so he tested

508
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,766
and it was the softest to ever

509
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:14,366
i wondered if perhaps they not equal in soltitude indeed

510
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:18,500
they were not so i made sure to note it remembering which was

511
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,300
which

512
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:24,933
what

513
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:27,966
if the tongue play you were about to perform

514
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,400
is that not happening

515
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:56,133
you are troubled

516
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,000
did he lie with you

517
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,300
no we were against the war

518
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,166
did you furious jump him

519
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,966
no he just passed looked by clitoris

520
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,200
i had the heat they needed release so in my request it was

521
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,466
you two may tongue play me

522
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:21,733
so not understanding this complicated feeling

523
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,300
are you now crying

524
00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:36,600

527
00:58:49,566 --> 00:58:56,000
a small incision is all that is needed

528
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,800
i was plotted from codes one morning

529
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,866
i may have ingested

530
00:59:12,866 --> 00:59:13,666
too much

531
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,533
i am going to venture to suggest

532
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:22,133
you are upset by bella's absence that needs a support sobbing

533

540
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:39,266
our feelings must be put aside

541
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:43,066
do you think my father could have branded me

542
00:59:43,066 --> 00:59:45,066
with hot irons of the genitals

543
00:59:45,066 --> 00:59:45,366

582
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:17,966

593
01:06:11,266 --> 01:06:12,600
but i find him to elicit

594
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,100
exceptional sensation

595
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,200
throughout my whole body that leave me yelping happily

596
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,000

me greatly as years have passed what's in between my ears

602
01:06:36,066 --> 01:06:37,733

forgot

622
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:25,866
polite society will destroy you

623
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:27,266
it will there

624
01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:28,333
there isn't truth enough

625
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:33,900
we all agreed on that as the inquiry on my hand occasionally

626
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:34,700
yes

627
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,800

actually

631
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,866
we are all on a ship and cannot escape

632
01:07:42,866 --> 01:07:45,366
and there is a world to enjoy traverse

633
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:46,366
circumnavigate

634
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:48,266
or can she not have friends

635
01:07:48,266 --> 01:07:51,066

you aside a few months and send you packing

639
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,266
but i cannot say oh

640
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:01,566
Mary me

641

642
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,533
it is tricky as i am engaged to Mr matts with candles

643
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:15,733
what my hand has taken by another it is a saying i heard

644
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:20,066
but did not understand you do not take just the hand at all

645
01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:20,733
do you not

646
01:08:20,733 --> 01:08:22,100
you ran away with me

647
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,900
from him

648
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,166
accounting of events the point of

649
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:30,533
which is elusive to me you chose me over him for now for fun

650
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:33,133
i'll fucking throw you overboard

651
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,800
so you wish to marry me or kill me

652
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,566
is that the proposal

653
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:39,366
no

654
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,800
that's fine

655
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:10,800
she is coming along

656
01:09:11,133 --> 01:09:16,333
let's try again gross mortar skills will develop slowly

657
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,266
but you will progress fast

658
01:09:21,133 --> 01:09:21,933
publicity

659
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,966
i'm reading Emerson speaks about the improvement men

660
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:46,966
i do not know why he does not give advice to women perhaps

661
01:09:46,966 --> 01:09:47,933
he does not know any

662
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:52,866
dry and read good philosophy is a

663
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:53,800
waste of time

664
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,100
Bella really say more no

665
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:57,800
no harry

666
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,933
you're wretched

667
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:04,466
it is a dagger people and society can be improved

668
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,133
it is the goal of all to prove advance progress grow

669
01:10:09,733 --> 01:10:10,600
i know this in me

670
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,266
and i'm sure i am indicative of all but trust me

671
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,366
you're definitely unique fella in always

672
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,300
but this improvement

673
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,333
through philosophy

674
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:23,100
is people trying to run away from the fact that we are all

675
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,533
cruel beasts born that way die that way

676
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:30,066
it is a dark view of things harry better

677
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,300
let us take the air

678
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:35,900
in our cabin

679
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,766
these two are fighting ideas of banging around in bella's head

680
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:42,566
and heart like lights in the storm

681
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:43,666

682
01:10:45,466 --> 01:10:47,100

683
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,900
Bella

684
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:51,866
you're losing some of your adorable way of speaking

685
01:10:51,866 --> 01:10:55,666
i'm a changingable feast as a rule of weak apparently

686
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:59,500
according to Emerson disagreed with by Harry come come just come

687
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,166

690
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:46,700
busy drinking heavily

691
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,166
busy losing heavily

692
01:12:30,866 --> 01:12:32,400
must go be Martha

693
01:12:34,133 --> 01:12:34,933
Martha

694
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:41,366
she is the problem after that perfume bag of flesh up

695
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,066
i dare you

696
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,166
where are you going

697
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,166
she's going over the side

698
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:06,366
all marvelous

699
01:13:06,366 --> 01:13:10,400
i never imagined being murdered how dramatic well

700
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,800
she seems happy to die i'm sorry for giving your life

701
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,766
i'll be on the ball

702
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,500
you have made me think cogitate harangulate on ideas

703
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,600
that are wrong erroneous

704
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,733
and nonsensically annoying that leave me not to sleep

705
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:24,533
so

706
01:14:26,566 --> 01:14:32,600
you say all a cruel and i disagree is a vow and say you're not

707
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,300
but when with Duncan

708
01:14:36,066 --> 01:14:38,366
the cruel just bubbles up in me

709
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:42,966
that shows good judgment he is a pretty moron

710
01:14:42,966 --> 01:14:43,766
no

711
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:50,000
i do not wish to be cruel i must improve this aspect myself

712
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,300
you don't know the world and you fear it

713
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,166
i do not do it do you want to see what

714
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,366
the world is really like

715
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,566
i'll show you yes

716
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:04,266
of course

717
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,166

718
01:15:54,766 --> 01:15:55,700
what is it

719
01:16:16,866 --> 01:16:20,566

721
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,900
we go down there

722
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,666
though quite right we rope us

723
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,100
rob us and rape us

724
01:16:33,733 --> 01:16:35,900
and if they were here and we were there

725
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:37,800
we do the same to them

726
01:18:27,466 --> 01:18:28,900
we are casting off mom

727
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,900
but i have to go back

728
01:18:31,733 --> 01:18:35,500
i i must give this money to the poor near the hotel

729
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,066
in what they call a son

730
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:39,733
we're staying a show mom

731
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,566
we could take care of that for you you can

732
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:50,066

749
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:21,500

766
01:21:14,966 --> 01:21:16,600

767
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:23,200
i gave it all to some nice men to pass on to the sun poor

768
01:21:24,066 --> 01:21:24,600
you'll be put

769
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,000

01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:16,566
you couldn't bear to see such dumb beautiful

780
01:22:16,566 --> 01:22:19,366

don't accept the live religion

786
01:22:29,766 --> 01:22:31,966
socialism capitalism

787
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,600
we are a fuck species know it hope is smashable

788
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,900
realism is not protect yourself with the truth

789
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,066

790
01:22:43,066 --> 01:22:43,866

just a broken little boy

792
01:22:45,066 --> 01:22:46,600
who cannot bear the pain of the world

793
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,800

798
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:28,466

803
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:45,466

01:23:45,466 --> 01:23:47,166
what we have no money

805
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:52,500
is it not an interesting experiment with nothing

806
01:23:52,933 --> 01:23:53,733
how will we live now

807
01:23:53,733 --> 01:23:55,500
i don't know exactly

808
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,600
that's the experiment we are now

809
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,000
the pool also

810
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,066
many adventurers have faced these odds

811
01:24:02,566 --> 01:24:04,400
Robertson cruiser for example

812
01:24:04,466 --> 01:24:05,800
selfish softless

813
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,133
careless bitch

i'm not faultless Duncan more

815
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,166
it is true my ability to think things

816
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:16,166
through to the logical conclusion is not strong

817
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,200
i did help those suffering people i have ruined us

818
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:21,500
as you pointed out

819
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:24,666
but i do believe my actions come from a good place

820
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,133
shut the fuck up

821
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:28,866

01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:06,000
so figure at this point

833
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,533
i am confused you're not here to work

834
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,300

837
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,766
if you need money

838
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,933
it is the shortest route to it

839
01:25:23,766 --> 01:25:26,666
i've never been cocked by another man

840
01:25:27,466 --> 01:25:28,666
yet i've wandered on that

841
01:25:29,566 --> 01:25:31,333
and i'm in need of funds

842
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:36,600
it is i believe a confluence of circumstances i regard

843
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,500
is almost fate

844
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
like let us do this

845
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,600
room sixteen

846
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,700

847
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,500

good day sir

850
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,933
the Clara shock

851
01:27:33,933 --> 01:27:34,733
a laugh

852
01:27:35,933 --> 01:27:40,266
i've come to some money and some enlightenment you still

853
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,766
you've always said

854
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:43,500
you're the best badman in the world

855
01:27:43,733 --> 01:27:45,166
and i've never known another

856
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,133
so knew not whether this is true

857
01:27:47,866 --> 01:27:48,933
but now i do

858
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:52,666
and he was terrible and made unbodly noises

859
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:54,466
as he thrust himself into me

860
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,133
and a mere three thrust

861
01:27:56,133 --> 01:27:58,600
Duncan went burn was only commanded first

862
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,300
i laugh but polite of course

863
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:02,900
i took his money

864
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,300
i thanked him i lost all the way to buy his busy players

865
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:11,400
but so fondly remembering the best sweaty nights of us

866
01:28:12,966 --> 01:28:15,800
fuck for money and as an experiment

867
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,366
which is good for our relationship is it gladdens

868
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,566
my heart told you

869
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,666
my heart has been a bit dim on your weedy squaring

870
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:24,700
person lately

871
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:27,533
you are a monster

872
01:28:27,533 --> 01:28:28,933
a horror monster

873
01:28:28,933 --> 01:28:31,700
a demon sent from hell to rip my spirit

874
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,566
defense to punish my tiny

875
01:28:34,566 --> 01:28:37,966
sins with a tsunami of destruction to take my heart

876
01:28:37,966 --> 01:28:39,900
and put in my topic to ruin me

877
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,200
i look at you when i see nothing

878
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,800
but happiness at last

879
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,266
it was uncalled for it makes no sense

880
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:49,100
as your odes to my beauty have been boring

881
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:54,600
but constant and the simple act of letting a strange man

882
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,133
ride on me has erased all that

883
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:02,700
what you you hold yourself

884
01:29:02,933 --> 01:29:05,333
you are now going to explain to me as bad

885
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:06,733
can i never win with you

886
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:09,200
it is the worst that woman can do

887
01:29:10,566 --> 01:29:12,666
we should definitely never marry

888
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:15,766
i'm a flawed experimenting person

889
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:18,700
and i will need a husband or the more forgiving this position

890
01:29:19,533 --> 01:29:21,533
can't i can now see

891
01:29:21,533 --> 01:29:24,700
you are not that our adventure is clearly over

892
01:29:25,133 --> 01:29:29,266
i shall book your passage back to London you had money

893
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:30,900
this whole time

894
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,266
it is god's money for emergencies

895
01:29:34,266 --> 01:29:36,766
it has been a fucking emergency for weeks now

896
01:29:36,766 --> 01:29:37,600
i believed in you

897
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,800
the whole time that you would rise to the occasion

898
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,866
but now i see that was a mistake

899
01:29:42,866 --> 01:29:44,766
and there's clearly something broken in you

900
01:29:44,766 --> 01:29:46,900
you propent something in me

901
01:29:47,066 --> 01:29:49,900
i feel this conversation has become circular

902
01:29:57,866 --> 01:30:02,066
Madam swine i had examined my situation i need sex and money

903
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:03,533
i could take a lover

904
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,666
another wedded burn

905
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:07,766
would keep me may require an awful lot of attention

906
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:09,666
or else it's twenty minutes at a time

907
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,966
and the rest of my days free study on the world

908
01:30:11,966 --> 01:30:13,266
and the improvement of it

909
01:30:13,733 --> 01:30:17,366
hence i seek employment that you must be smelling

910
01:30:17,366 --> 01:30:19,266
establishment of good time fornication

911
01:30:19,266 --> 01:30:24,333
a woman plotting her course to freedom and not all

912
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:31,533
i'm mister saver

913
01:30:33,466 --> 01:30:34,500
i feel in you

914
01:30:35,166 --> 01:30:37,066
a prime cart

915
01:30:37,466 --> 01:30:40,733

916
01:30:49,933 --> 01:30:50,800

01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:24,966
they see it was brutal in a strangely not

924
01:32:24,966 --> 01:32:25,900
unpleasant way

925
01:32:29,666 --> 01:32:32,666

926

01:32:36,066 --> 01:32:37,866

928
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
i'm mad too

929
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,266
madam swiney this lineup system

930
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,733
you really expect me to go upstairs with the man

931
01:32:56,733 --> 01:32:58,366
even if i find him distasteful

932
01:32:58,533 --> 01:32:59,200
and therefore

933
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:02,166
i'm sad when i let him curious jump me

934
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:04,533
that is the way it is i hardly

935
01:33:07,733 --> 01:33:11,733
'cause you're the pretty how it agrees with you to be rapaged

936
01:33:12,566 --> 01:33:13,500
suppose sir

937
01:33:13,933 --> 01:33:17,166
no we feel we we miss master Bella

938
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,400
so would you not prefer it

939
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:23,366
if the women chose as it would be a sign of enthusiasm told you

940
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,066
you wouldn't have the vague sense that they're

941
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:27,000
in a state of horror

942
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,866
when you jump them

943
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,700
ah huh and that's all fine who's here

944
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:31,966
monsieur millso

945
01:33:31,966 --> 01:33:37,733
Bella is new and may have a mental illness and the compost of

946
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:39,966
god my father

947
01:33:39,966 --> 01:33:40,766
says

948
01:33:40,766 --> 01:33:43,600
it is only the way it is until we discover the new way it is

949
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,200
and then that is

950
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,366
the way it is until we discover the new way it is

951
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:48,766
and so it goes until the world is no longer flat

952
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:49,700
electricity lights

953
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:52,000
the night and shoots no longer time with ribbons

954
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:56,300
Russian echo as a socially stable entire fondo tonight

955
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:56,700

01:34:02,966 --> 01:34:06,700

959
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:16,100

960
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,766
oh i am sorry i drew blunt yeah

961
01:34:24,766 --> 01:34:28,366
but sometimes give in to myself a nicely beauty

962
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,733
young beauty for one day my dear

963
01:34:30,933 --> 01:34:34,466
you will be a wrinkled old husk and now

964
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:36,500
i will want you either to pay for it

965
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,066
or to have it for free

966
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:40,866
i still believe everyone will be happier

967
01:34:40,866 --> 01:34:44,533
if we could choose an idea like me

968
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:47,000
how delightful you are

969
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,900
but we must give in to the demands of the world

970
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:53,800
sometimes grapple with it try to defeat him

971
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,733
do you believe it's me

972
01:34:54,733 --> 01:35:01,166
of course but some men enjoy that you do not like him what

973
01:35:03,133 --> 01:35:06,200
i think that good business

974
01:35:06,866 --> 01:35:07,666
probably

975
01:35:12,933 --> 01:35:18,400
my grandchild seeking poorly and requiring much doctoring

976
01:35:18,566 --> 01:35:23,266
my choice of giving you choice will jeopardize the business

977
01:35:23,366 --> 01:35:26,500
her health her life do you want that Bella

978
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:29,666

01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,200

we must make money

982
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,100
but more than that we must experience everything

983
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,366
not just the good

984
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,766
but degradation horror sadness

985
01:35:47,766 --> 01:35:49,666
this makes us whole better

986
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:55,100
most people of substance not flighty untouched children

987
01:35:56,366 --> 01:35:57,900
then we can know the world

988
01:35:59,133 --> 01:36:00,600
only know the world

989
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,766

990
01:36:04,766 --> 01:36:11,966
but now go and fuck someone and bring me ten francs

i look at you

1058
01:42:05,933 --> 01:42:07,766
and feel nothing for the lingering question of how did

1059
01:42:07,766 --> 01:42:08,566
i ever want you

1060
01:42:08,566 --> 01:42:09,366

but improving eight foot genius can you not be so poor to her

1069
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,400
i made a mistake with mala

1070
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:53,366
allowed feelings to develop the long for her

1071
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,900
she is no different to the chicken dog

1072
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:58,933
but it is better this way perhaps

1073
01:42:59,266 --> 01:43:01,933
give some insight into my father's cruel system

1074

01:44:37,566 --> 01:44:38,200
i heard

1093
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,900
you said that to the others

1094
01:44:40,533 --> 01:44:43,866

you are my children i feed with love

1096
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,533
something terrible has happened

1097
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:57,866
so i feel almost nothing

1098
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:02,066
my empathy is creeping toward what

1099
01:45:02,066 --> 01:45:05,266
i would describe as contemptuous rage

1100
01:45:05,266 --> 01:45:06,766
it is fabulous

1101
01:45:07,266 --> 01:45:08,066
it is

1102
01:45:10,966 --> 01:45:16,800
you are in the dark period before light and wisdom come to you

1103
01:45:18,133 --> 01:45:20,000
you must forge through it

1104
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:24,666
and once on the other side you will be grateful to this moment

1105
01:45:24,666 --> 01:45:27,766
but you must keep going i see

1106

1110
01:46:55,966 --> 01:46:58,266

he is such a demon at large into the world of devil's rat

1117
01:47:58,866 --> 01:48:02,166
and a luring body that cannot be satiated in her mind

1118
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:03,600
that picks people apart

1119
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,700
Stitch by Stitch

1120
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:08,266

01:52:56,666 --> 01:52:57,566
we miss you

1178
01:52:58,166 --> 01:52:59,166
monsters

1179
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:04,266
bang

1180
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,900
bang bang

1181
01:53:43,666 --> 01:53:45,166
it is hard to be in a position

1182
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:48,300
where one wants to hit someone who is already in obvious pain

1183
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:51,200
it is a conunctor for sure

1184
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:53,300
would

1185
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:56,933
you rather be erased by the flesh with a fish up in your nose

1186
01:53:57,066 --> 01:53:59,766
i will feel good for a second about for longers

1187
01:54:01,366 --> 01:54:02,333
i really had a fish

1188
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:03,966
look at my nose you did

1189
01:54:06,366 --> 01:54:07,966
so i am your creation

1190
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:10,766
has this the other

1191
01:54:10,766 --> 01:54:12,133
one neither of you are

1192
01:54:12,133 --> 01:54:15,700
that she wanders the halls with a hammer and a song

1193
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,133
and that is not my doing and i read your cards and letters home

1194
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:23,200
and watched you fearlessly create by a bachelor with one

1195
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,866
but i am finding being alive fascinating

1196
01:54:25,866 --> 01:54:27,266
so i'll forgive you the act

1197
01:54:28,166 --> 01:54:32,366
but always hate the lies and trapping that followed understood

1198
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,066
good to see you you too

1199
01:54:41,766 --> 01:54:44,966
i made confusion and brain dissonance aside i missed you

1200
01:54:46,166 --> 01:54:48,400
i arrived home when i smelled the famaldehyde

1201
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,733
and i knew what is fixed

1202
01:54:52,366 --> 01:54:53,666
i will be a doctor

1203
01:54:55,066 --> 01:54:57,000
my surgery is yours

1204
01:54:58,933 --> 01:55:00,300
my father wants to

1205
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:06,166
always carve with compassion he was a fucking idiot

1206
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,066
but it's not that advice

1207
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:15,266
it does not have long i know

1208
01:55:17,266 --> 01:55:18,733
you've not mentioned our betrothal

1209
01:55:20,933 --> 01:55:22,800
you were much younger

1210
01:55:23,933 --> 01:55:28,466
there is no bind i was mesmerized by you and backstage advantage

1211
01:55:28,466 --> 01:55:30,100
so you were mesmerized no more

1212
01:55:30,266 --> 01:55:32,900
i am still mesmerized

1213
01:55:33,866 --> 01:55:38,200
i've been a whole you understand hmm Cox for money inside me

1214
01:55:38,666 --> 01:55:39,733
you okay with that

1215
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,766
does the horing thing challenge the desire for ownership

1216
01:55:43,766 --> 01:55:45,900
that men have when Devon became

1217
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:49,133
much weed being swearing when he discovered my horing

1218
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,766
i find myself nearly jealous of the men's time

1219
01:55:52,766 --> 01:55:56,066
with you rather than any moral aspersion against you

1220
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,300
it is your body better Baxter

1221
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,566
you will see you free

1222
01:56:00,933 --> 01:56:03,366
i generally charge thirty francs well

1223
01:56:03,666 --> 01:56:05,066
that seems low

1224
01:56:06,366 --> 01:56:08,500
do you believe people improvable max

1225
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:13,333
i do just as a human body can be cured of illness

1226
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:16,400
so can men and women be cured of aspect

1227
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,700
will you marry me back to candice

1228
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:23,466
i will

1229
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,500
we will need less of your time in the future

1230
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,966
but overall most agreeable

1231
01:56:33,966 --> 01:56:34,400

1232
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:41,066

1233
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,000

1236
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,600

1239
01:57:12,133 --> 01:57:13,366

1241
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,700
to walk you down the island

1242
01:57:30,066 --> 01:57:32,866
i'm sorry by the powers vested in me by the church

1243
01:57:33,066 --> 01:57:36,133
i shall solemnize this union do you

1244
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:37,200

1245
01:57:37,666 --> 01:57:38,600

1246
01:57:39,066 --> 01:57:39,866
as your husband

1247
01:57:39,866 --> 01:57:42,533
did we miss the part about anyone objecting to this

1248
01:57:43,166 --> 01:57:45,933
or has that been removed in some kind of foe

1249
01:57:45,933 --> 01:57:47,966
modernization of the catanism

1250
01:57:51,333 --> 01:57:52,400
hello Victoria

1251
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,200
you look well

1252
01:57:55,533 --> 01:57:57,133
do you refer to me sir

1253
01:57:57,666 --> 01:58:00,566
the man doesn't normally introduce himself to his wife

1254
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:04,466
but if i must delete he is the golden

1255
01:58:05,266 --> 01:58:06,900
and you don't know if he's in her power

1256
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:10,333
or she in his his devil's work at hands look

1257
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,900
they calls not as an old man of blood

1258
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:15,166

1259
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:19,766
don't you don't play your eyes on me demon

1260
01:58:21,966 --> 01:58:25,366
as i was saying general Alfred blessington

1261
01:58:27,933 --> 01:58:28,933
you really do not know

1262
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,800
when Mister Weddeberg put your photo in the paper

1263
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,133
i remember when that old bird in the hotel

1264
01:58:35,133 --> 01:58:37,200
called the Victoria blessing kid

1265
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,900
and i pieced this dial follicle fuck

1266
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:41,400
best of a puzzle together

1267
01:58:43,466 --> 01:58:45,166
you are your dear ralphie

1268
01:58:45,866 --> 01:58:48,966
you left in the state of some mental abdomen

1269
01:58:48,966 --> 01:58:52,966
and mysterio of your pregnancy on the discovery of your absence

1270
01:58:52,966 --> 01:58:54,500
i felt disemboweled

1271
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:57,400
i have disemboweled met on the field of battle

1272
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:04,466
i always imagined a dull hollow robbing that is what he was like

1273
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,366
is also stench

1274
01:59:06,366 --> 01:59:09,566
but that does not apply as a metaphor here

1275
01:59:11,333 --> 01:59:13,266
but here you are my darling

1276

what drove her to leave off the bridge

1307

and yet i'm happy to have you home

1311

1329
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,933
your sexual hysteria was often out in half

1330
02:03:39,066 --> 02:03:41,166
and for the killing of our unborn child

1331

in fact when i list the ways you wrote me

1332
02:03:44,766 --> 02:03:48,566
Jesus Christ himself would probably beat your headed with a bat

1333

1340
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,500
ringing the Ukrainium

1341
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:12,366

1342
02:04:12,366 --> 02:04:15,366
we stick close to the house for several months maybe a year

1343
02:04:18,466 --> 02:04:19,966
until you've made a full recovery

1344
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:23,700
i will leave it my leisure

1345
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:26,200
but i am flattered by your desire to trap me

1346
02:04:28,166 --> 02:04:29,133

1347
02:04:31,366 --> 02:04:35,133

1352
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,533

1358
02:05:18,166 --> 02:05:22,000
as i do not wish to stay if one must drown

1359
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:24,066
let it be in the river of love

1360
02:05:33,966 --> 02:05:34,766

1362
02:05:38,766 --> 02:05:40,000

1370
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,966
they're holding the federal package

1371
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,366
it will come on that way

1372
02:07:09,266 --> 02:07:10,600

1380
02:07:39,466 --> 02:07:43,166
like to leave i found our time together interesting

1381
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:44,200
but if i ascertained

1382
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,766
why i jumped from a bridge

1383
02:07:46,533 --> 02:07:50,066
i wish to go see my near dead god adorable

1384

see a man spends his life

1391
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,866
wrangling his sexual compulsion

1392
02:08:11,866 --> 02:08:13,800
it's a curse and yet in some ways

1393
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:17,133

02:08:33,733 --> 02:08:37,066
removed brain from the baby transplanted it into my head

1401
02:08:37,066 --> 02:08:38,333

1404

1405
02:08:49,133 --> 02:08:51,800
and yet at some point there's nothing left but to pull a gun

1406
02:08:53,366 --> 02:08:54,500

in some ways

1412
02:09:29,966 --> 02:09:34,500
it would be a relief to be rid of by questing self sit deeply

1413
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:36,000
and that freedom is yours
